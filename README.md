PacketWeaver (pw) is a Python script filing and task sequencing framework.

PacketWeaver is a Python framework, which helps build, organize and reuse your Python scripts. It is the most efficient when used in network script development projects.                                                           
                                                                                
It sets you up with a simple boilerplate to help building reusable scripts with a clear self-checked input interface and the ability for scripts to be chained between each others. These scripts can be organized into importable packages.  This way they can be grouped by projects or topics and easily shared alongside the framework.                                                                  

In addition to that, it provides a convenient interactive command line interface (CLI) to search, configure and run your scripts and a CLI to run your scripts from your favorite shell and other tools.
